                                    [Intro: Bēkon]
                                    <br>
                    Love's gonna get you killed
                    But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
                    And you and you and you and me
                    And you and you and you and me
                    And you and you and you and me and—
                <br>
                    [Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
                    <br>
                    Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
                    In another life, I surely was there
                    Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
                    I care, I care  
                <br>
                    [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
                    <br>
                    Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
                    Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
                    The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
                    Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
                    See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
                    I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
                    I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
                    I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
                    I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
                    This time I might put you down
                    Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
                    My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
                    I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
                    Pity parties and functions of you and yours
                    A perfect world, you probably live another 24
                    I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
                    I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
                <br>
                    [Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
                    <br>
                    Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
                    In another life, I surely was there
                    Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
                    I care, I care
                    <br>

                    [Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
                    <br>
                    Maybe I wasn’t there
                    Maybe I wasn't there
                    Maybe I wasn't there
                    Maybe I wasn't there
                    <br>

                    [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
                    <br>
                    Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
                    Cold as December but never remember what winter did
                    I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
                    Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
                    Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
                    Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
                    I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
                    The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
                    Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
                    A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
                    Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
                    Race barriers make inferior you and I
                    See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
                    I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
                    I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
                    Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
                    <br>

                    [Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
                    <br>
                    Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
                    In another life, I surely was there
                    Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
                    I care, I care
                    <br>

                    [Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
                    <br>
                    Maybe I wasn't there
                    Maybe I wasn't there
                    Maybe I wasn't there
                    Maybe I wasn't there
