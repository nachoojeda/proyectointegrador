                I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
                Spendin' nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
                I could fly home, with my eyes closed
                But it'd get kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
                And you could find me, I ain't hidin'
                I don't move my feet when I be glidin'
                I just slide in and then I roll
                Out
