                        [Verse 1]
                        <br>
                        Round your city, round the clock
                        Everybody needs you
                        No, you can't make everybody equal
                        Although you got beaucoup family
                        You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
                        Breathe 'til I evaporated
                        My whole body see through
                        Transportation, handmade (G)
                        And I know it better than most people
                        I don't trust 'em anyways
                        You can't break the law with them
                        Get some gushy, have a calm night
                        Shooters killin' left and right
                        Workin' through your worst night
                        If I get my money right
                        You know I won't need you
                        And I tell you, (bitch)
                        I hope the sack is full up
                        I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
                        Spend it when I get that
                        I ain't tryna keep you
                        Can't keep up a conversation
                        Can't nobody reach you
                        Why your eyes well up?
                        Did you call me from a séance?
                        You are from my past life
                        Hope you're doin' well, bruh
                        I been out here head first
                        Always like the head first
                        Signal comin' in and out
                        Hope you're doin' well, bruh
                        Everybody needs you, everybody needs you
                        Oooh, nani nani
                        This feel like a quaalude
                        No sleep in my body
                        Ain't no bitch in my body
                        <br>

                        [Pre-Chorus]

                        New beginnin's, wake up akh
                        The sun's goin' down
                        Time to start your day, bruh
                        Can't keep bein' laid off
                        Know you need the money if you gon' survive
                        The every night shit, every day shit
                        <br>

                        [Chorus]
                        <br>
                        Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
                        You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
                        That kumbaya shit
                        Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
                        Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
                        Fuck with me after my shift
                        Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
                        Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
                        That's every day shit
                        Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
                        Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
                        My every day shit, every night shit, my every day shit
                        (Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)
                        <br>

                        [Bridge]
                        <br>
                        All my night, been ready for you all my night
                        Been waitin' on you all my night
                        I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside
                        All my night, you been missin' all my night
                        Still got some good nights memorized
                        And the look back's gettin' me right

                        <br>

                        [Verse 2]
                        <br>
                        Every night fucks every day up
                        Every day patches the night up
                        On God, you should match it, it's that KO
                        No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
                        1998, my family had that Acura
                        Oh, the Legend
                        Kept at least six discs in the changer
                        Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
                        Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
                        All the reverends
                        Preachin' self made millionaire status
                        When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
                        After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
                        Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
                        Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
                        Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
                        Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night
                        <br>

                        [Chorus]
                        <br>
                        Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
                        You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
                        That kumbaya shit
                        Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
                        Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
                        Fuck with me after my shift
                        Know them boys wanna see me broke down
                        See me bummed out, stressed out
                        That's just everyday shit
                        Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
                        Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
                        My every day shit, my every day shit
                        My every night shit, my every day shit
                        My every day shit, my every day shit
                        My every day shit, my every night shit
